I am a postdoctoral researcher in [the Schwarz Lab](https://iccb-cologne.org/groups/schwarzlab/profile) at the Institute for Computational Cancer Biology at the University of Cologne and the Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data @ the Technical University of Berlin. I am an applied mathematician by training and use computational and mathematical methods to investigate cancer evolution. My research interests include cancer evolution, stochastic processes, and simulations of carcinogenesis.
