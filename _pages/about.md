# About 
I am (soon to be) a postdoctoral researcher in [Roland Schwarz's group](https://iccb-cologne.org/groups/schwarzlab/profile) at the Institute for Computational Cancer Biology at the University of Cologne. I am an applied mathematician by training and use computational and mathematical methods to investigate cancer evolution. My research interests include cancer evolution, stochastic processes, and simulations of carcinogenesis.
